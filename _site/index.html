      <h1>Technology for Development Playbook</h1>

<p>Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) play a critical role for Peace Corps Volunteers wishing to have the most effective, efficient, and sustainable impact as possible. ICT has become a recognized tool for development writ large, and conversely, the lack of ICT has become a barrier to full inclusion in a globally networked society.</p>

<p>ICT4D is not simply about the potential of technology, but about the realities of technology-induced social change.</p>

<p>To assist Volunteers and their projects, the Peace Corps has convened on a broad technology for development approach. We created a playbook of key “plays”.</p>

      <h5>PLAY 1</h5>
      <h2>Listen to the community</h2>

      <p>Volunteers put in the time, the energy, and the importance of becoming a part of their communities and understanding them to the best of their abilities. Think of your communities first, and on the impact that your efforts will have on the lives of those around them. Focus on enabling environments and empowerment for those closest to the problem.</p>

    </div>
  
    <div class="inner_container">
      <a class="anchor_offset" id="play2"></a>
      <h5>PLAY 2</h5>
      <h2>Design for scale and sustainability</h2>

      <p>Volunteers look to have global impact through community-level actions -- and not simply in the near-term. The changes in communication and technologies allow Volunteers to share experiences, resources, and models for replicating, scaling, and transforming their efforts across our global reach.</p>

    </div>
  
    <div class="inner_container">
      <a class="anchor_offset" id="play3"></a>
      <h5>PLAY 3</h5>
      <h2>Focus on needs and challenges, not on technologies</h2>

      <p>Focus on solving local problems that are debated, defined and refined by local people in an ongoing process. Foster real results – real solutions to real problems that have real impact: they build trust, empower people and promote sustainability.</p>

    </div>
  
    <div class="inner_container">
      <a class="anchor_offset" id="play4"></a>
      <h5>PLAY 4</h5>
      <h2>Start simple and use what we know works</h2>

      <p>Support projects and practices that we <em>know</em> work. Don’t always pursue what’s new or flashy. Build using simple approaches, simple technologies, and simple solutions.</p>

    </div>
  
    <div class="inner_container">
      <a class="anchor_offset" id="play5"></a>
      <h5>PLAY 5</h5>
      <h2>Co-create and build with buy-in</h2>

      <p>Legitimize at all levels (political, managerial and social), building ownership and momentum throughout the process to be ‘locally owned’ in reality (not just on paper). Volunteers are by nature and training inclusive. They bring anyone and everyone to the table—the ones with strong voices as well as those who have not traditionally had a voice at the table. Peace Corps knows that we can go further, together. Mix up innovation teams with ideas people and experienced builders.</p>

    </div>
  
    <div class="inner_container">
      <a class="anchor_offset" id="play6"></a>
      <h5>PLAY 6</h5>
      <h2>Use open standards</h2>

      <p>Volunteers in the field are optimally placed to help their communities benefit from the incredible strides that open systems and innovation have made, and their potential for impact.</p>

    </div>
  
    <div class="inner_container">
      <a class="anchor_offset" id="play7"></a>
      <h5>PLAY 7</h5>
      <h2>Tinker, make, do</h2>

      <p>Volunteers are tinkerers, makers, and hackers. Volunteers do more with less. They help their communities to start where they are, use what they have, and do what they can—starting the day they arrive.</p>

    </div>
  
    <div class="inner_container">
      <a class="anchor_offset" id="play8"></a>
      <h5>PLAY 8</h5>
      <h2>Listen, learn, adjust, and iterate</h2>

      <p>Blend design and implementation through rapid cycles of planning, action, reflection and revision (drawing on local knowledge, feedback and energy) to foster learning from both success and failure. Manage risks by making ‘small bets’: pursuing activities with promise and dropping others.</p>

    </div>
  
    <div class="inner_container">
      <a class="anchor_offset" id="play9"></a>
      <h5>PLAY 9</h5>
      <h2>Protect privacy and security</h2>

      <p>Volunteers think first of their communities, and look to help them in ways that protect the privacy, safety, and security of everyone they engage with.</p>
