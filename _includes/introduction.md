# Technology for Development Playbook

Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) play a critical role for Peace Corps Volunteers wishing to have the most effective, efficient, and sustainable impact as possible. ICT has become a recognized tool for development writ large, and conversely, the lack of ICT has become a barrier to full inclusion in a globally networked society.

ICT4D is not simply about the potential of technology, but about the realities of technology-induced social change.

To assist Volunteers and their projects, the Peace Corps has convened on a broad technology for development approach. We created a playbook of key “plays”.
