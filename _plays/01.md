title: Listen to the community
---

Volunteers put in the time, the energy, and the importance of becoming a part of their communities and understanding them to the best of their abilities. Think of your communities first, and on the impact that your efforts will have on the lives of those around them. Focus on enabling environments and empowerment for those closest to the problem.
